The Assignment
==============

Quoted from Coursera:

You should create one R script called run\_analysis.R that does the
following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. Extracts
only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each
measurement. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in
the data set Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable
names. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy
data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each
subject.

The Data (taken from README.txt)
================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers
within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six
activities (WALKING, WALKING\_UPSTAIRS, WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING,
STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the
waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured
3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant
rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data
manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two
sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the
training data and 30% the test data.

The dataset includes the following files:
-----------------------------------------

-   ‘README.txt’

-   ‘features\_info.txt’: Shows information about the variables used on
    the feature vector.

-   ‘features.txt’: List of all features.

-   ‘activity\_labels.txt’: Links the class labels with their activity
    name.

-   ‘train/X\_train.txt’: Training set.

-   ‘train/y\_train.txt’: Training labels.

-   ‘test/X\_test.txt’: Test set.

-   ‘test/y\_test.txt’: Test labels.

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
